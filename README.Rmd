# Machine learning workflow management with drake

Machine learning workflows can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) R package. [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with [optional distributed computing](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html), and organizes the output so you rarely have to think about data files. This workshop will teach you how to create and maintain machine learning projects with [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)-powered automation.

# Installation

To obtain the workshop materials, install the [`learndrake`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake) package, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wlandau/learndrake")
tensorflow::install_tensorflow()
keras::install_keras()
```

# Usage: browser

Just click this badge: [![Launch Rstudio Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wlandau/learndrake/binder?urlpath=rstudio). Your browser will open the materials in a free RStudio Server instance. The exercises are in the notebooks (`1-churn/1-churn.Rmd`, `2-setup/2-setup.Rmd`, etc.).

# Usage: local

The functions in `learndrake` help navigate and deploy the workshop materials. If you installed the package and dependencies as above, you can take the workshop locally without an internet connection.

Function | Purpose
---|---
`view_slides()` | Open the introductory slides in a web browser.
`save_notebooks()` | Save the tutorials to your computer: R notebooks and supporting files.
`launch_app()` | Launch a Shiny app that accompanies a tutorial.
`save_app()` | Save the app files so you can deploy to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) or [Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server).

# Introductory slides

The workshop begins with an introductory presentation on [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). View the slides at <https://wlandau.github.io/learndrake/index.html> or open them yourself in a browser with `view_slides()`. 

# Tutorials

After the introductory presentation, students work through a sequence of R notebooks in order. Use `save_notebooks()` to save the notebooks and supporting files to your computer.

Notebook | Topic
---|---
`1-churn.Rmd` | Deep learning case study
`2-setup.Rmd` | Convert the case study to a new [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) project.
`3-flow.Rmd`  | Develop, work, and iterate on the project.
`4-plans` | A deep dive into [`drake` plans](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html).
`5-files` | Custom input and output data files.
`6-reports` | Special considerations of `knitr` and R Markdown reports.
`7-hpc` | High-performance computing

# Apps

Notebooks `3-flow.Rmd` and `4-plans.Rmd` come with supporting Shiny apps to conduct the learning exercises.

App | Notebook | Deploy locally | Public URL
---|---|---|---
Iterate on a [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow | `3-flow.Rmd` | `launch_app("flow")` | <http://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow>
