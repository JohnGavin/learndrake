# Reproducible workflows at scale with `drake`

Ambitious workflows in R, such as machine learning analyses, can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) R package. [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with [optional distributed computing](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/hpc.html), and organizes the output so you rarely have to think about data files. This workshop will teach you how to create and maintain machine learning projects with [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)-powered automation.

# Installation

To obtain the workshop materials, install the [`learndrake`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake) package, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wlandau/learndrake")
keras::install_keras()
# Check if the installation succeeded.
tensorflow::tf_config()
```

If you are using RStudio version 1.2.5003 and encounter [this fatal error](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/6049), consider downgrading TensorFlow to version 1.13.1. Note: `install_keras()` silently tries to upgrade TensorFlow to version >= 2, so you will need to run it with `tensorflow = "1.13.1`.

# Usage

## RStudio Cloud (pre-built)

1. Sign up for [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). 
2. Navigate to <https://rstudio.cloud/project/627076> to open a new copy of the workshop.
3. Optional: save a permanent copy so you can come back to it later. Look for the red "temporary copy" text at the top and click the "save a permanent copy"  option next to it.

## RStudio Cloud (custom)

This approach takes a bit longer to set up than the pre-built project.

1. Sign up for [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). 
2. Create a fresh new project.
3. Run [this setup script](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/blob/master/inst/notebooks/rstudio-cloud-setup.R) to install the dependencies and download the materials.

## Binder

Just click this badge: [![Launch RStudio Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wlandau/learndrake/binder?urlpath=rstudio). Your browser will open the materials in a free RStudio Server instance. 

- Advantage: no need to sign up for RStudio Cloud.
- Disadvantage: long load times and quick timeouts.

## Local

The functions in `learndrake` help navigate and deploy the workshop materials. If you installed the package and dependencies as above, you can take the workshop locally without an internet connection. Start with the introductory slides, then move on to the notebooks. Launch apps along the way as directed.

Function | Purpose
---|---
`launch_app()` | Launch a Shiny app that accompanies a tutorial.
`save_app()` | Save the app files so you can deploy to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) or [Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server).
`save_notebooks()` | Save the tutorials to your computer: R notebooks and supporting files.
`save_slides()` | Save the introductory slides to your computer.
`view_slides()` | Open the introductory slides in a web browser.

# Introductory presentation

The workshop begins with an introductory presentation on [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). You can find a video recording [here](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-09-24/). Alternatively, you can view the slides at <https://wlandau.github.io/learndrake/index.html> or open them yourself in a browser with `view_slides()`.

# Tutorials

After the introductory presentation, students work through a sequence of R notebooks in order. Use `save_notebooks()` to save the notebooks and supporting files to your computer.

Dynamic branching | [`5-dynamic/5-dynamic.Rmd`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/blob/master/inst/notebooks/5-dynamic/5-dynamic.Rmd)
Files and R Markdown | [`6-files/6-files.Rmd`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/blob/master/inst/notebooks/6-files/6-files.Rmd)

# Apps

Notebooks `3-changes.Rmd` and `4-static.Rmd` come with supporting Shiny apps to conduct the learning exercises. Use `launch_app()` to run any of these apps locally.
