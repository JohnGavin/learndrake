# Machine learning workflow management with drake

Machine learning workflows can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) R package. [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with [optional distributed computing](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/hpc.html), and organizes the output so you rarely have to think about data files. This workshop will teach you how to create and maintain machine learning projects with [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)-powered automation.

# Installation

To obtain the workshop materials, simply install the `learndrake` package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("wlandau/learndrake")
```

# Usage

The functions in `learndrake` help navigate and deploy the workshop materials.

Function | Purpose
---|---
`view_slides()` | Open the introductory slides in a web browser.
`save_notebooks()` | Save the tutorials to your computer: R notebooks and supporting files.
`launch_app()` | Launch a Shiny app that accompanies a tutorial.
`save_app()` | Save the app files so you can deploy to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) or [Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server).

# Introductory slides

The workshop begins with an introductory presentation on [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). View the slides at <https://wlandau.github.io/learndrake/slides/index.html> or open them yourself in a browser with `view_slides()`. 

# Tutorials

After the introductory presentation, students work through a sequence of R notebooks in order. Use `save_notebooks()` to save the notebooks and supporting files to your computer.

Notebook | Topic
---|---
`1-churn.Rmd` | Deep learning case study
`2-setup.Rmd` | Convert the case study to a new [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) project.
`3-flow.Rmd`  | Develop, work, and iterate on the project.
`4-plans` | A deep dive into [`drake` plans](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html).
`5-files` | Custom input and output data files.
`6-reports` | Special considerations of `knitr` and R Markdown reports.
`7-hpc` | High-performance computing

# Apps

Notebooks `3-flow.Rmd` and `4-plans.Rmd` come with supporting Shiny apps to conduct the learning exercises.
