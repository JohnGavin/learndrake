1. Navigate to the `3-changes/` folder.
2. Open `3-changes.Rproj` as an RStudio project in a new R session. (Click on `3-changes.Rproj` in RStudio's file manager.)
3. Check that your working directory is correct. It should be `3-changes/`.

```{r}
basename(getwd()) # Should be "3-changes"
```

4. Run the setup chunk below.

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("../config/options.R")
```

# Instructions

# Write your scratch work below

Or use `3-changes.R` or just the R console.

```{r, paged.print = FALSE}

```
