# Do first

1. Navigate to the `3-flow/` folder.
2. Open `3-flow.Rproj` as an RStudio project in a new R session. (Click on `3-flow.Rproj` in RStudio's file manager.)
3. Check that your working directory is correct. It should be `3-flow/`.

```{r}
basename(getwd()) # Should be "3-flow"
```

4. Run the setup chunk below.

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("../config/options.R")
```

# Instructions 

Navigate to the [`learndrakeflow` app](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow) and complete the exercises in order. If the app does not load in the browser, you can launch it locally with [`learndrake::launch_app("flow")`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake).

# Scratch

You may wish to write scratch work below as you complete the exercises. Otherwise, use an R script (`scratch.R`) or use the console.

```{r, scratch}



```
