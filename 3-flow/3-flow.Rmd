```{r, include = FALSE}
# Set your working directory to 3-flow/.
# You may have to copy and paste this line into your console:
setwd(file.path(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(), "3-flow"))
source("../config/options.R")
```

# Instructions 

Navigate to the [`learndrakeflow` app](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow) and complete the exercises in order. If the app does not load in the browser, you can launch it locally with [`learndrake::launch_app("flow")`](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake).

# Scratch

You may wish to write scratch work below as you complete the exercises. Otherwise, use an R script (`scratch.R`) or use the console.

```{r, scratch}



```
