```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

## Model runs

This active code chunk summarizes all our model runs. The `loadd()` statement tells `drake` to rerun this report whenever the `run` target changes.

```{r}
loadd(run)
run
```

## Your turn

Write a new code chunk with `readd(best_model)`. That way, `drake` will rerun this report whenever `best_model` changes.
