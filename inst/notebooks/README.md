Welcome to the `drake` workshop! To get started, navigate to `1-functions/` in the "Files" pane and click on `1-functions.Rproj`. Then, open the `1-functions.Rmd` notebook. As you read along, it is helpful to run the code chunks by clicking the green arrows at the upper right-hand corner of each chunk. When you are done, continue on to the notebook in the other folders. The various `*-solutions/` folders have the solutions to exercises in the notebooks.
