# Notebooks

These files are part of a hands-on workshop on [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake). Participants are to work through the folders in the order they are numbered. Each numbered folder has an R notebook (an `*.Rmd` file) with instructions and exercises. For more information, please visit <https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake>.
